# The why

I was unsatisfied with most macro software. Why? The GUI was too slow. Also I partially wanted to have fun.

### Note: Due to the library I'm using, Wayland display server (on Linux) is unsupported :(

# Inspiration

I was playing a game composed of mindless grinding. It was fun, but it was so brainless that it could be automated. Problem is, I wasn't satisfied with most macro software (or AHK) so now I'm making my own thing
